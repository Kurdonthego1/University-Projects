ENSE 352 Lab - Final Project

</div>

### **Project Descrition:**

This project was made for ENSE 352 - Computer Systems Architecture Lab Final.

Goals of this project include:
- Working implementation of Simon, a memory recall game
- 4 Button input with 4 LED outputs
- Test the user's memory ability to perform 10 rounds of Simon

### **What is Simon?:**

Simon is a short-term memory test designed to challenge users to follow a random sequence of LEDs
In order to win you must be able to remember and recall the sequence of LEDs shown

### **How it works?:**

Using an STMF103RB microcontroller along with a bread board, there are 4 buttons for user input and 4 LEDs that correspond with a specific operation in the game.

The Simon game starts off by showing a sequence of LEDs flowing left and right, this is mimicing the Knight Rider sequence
- LEDs start from the left, goes 1 by 1 until it hits the last LED then it will perform the same sequence to the right 1 by 1 and repeat until user input is detected from any of the buttons
